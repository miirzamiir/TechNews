# TechNews

**TechNews** is a RESTful API designed for the backend of a technology news website. This project was developed as part of a backend internship at **Roshan** and is structured around three main challenges.

## Challenge 1: News Retrieval API

The first challenge focuses on creating a RESTful API to retrieve news articles. Each `news` record includes essential attributes such as `title`, `text`, `tags`, and `resource`. To successfully complete this challenge, the following tasks were undertaken:

1. **Database Model Design & Implementation:**  
   Designing and implementing the underlying database structure to store news articles efficiently.

2. **API Implementation:**  
   Developing the API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting news records.

3. **Filter by Tag Feature:**  
   Adding functionality to filter news articles based on specific tags.

4. **Unit Testing:**  
   Writing unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the API.

Due to complete these tasks, at first I created the repository and added `.gitignore` and `README.md` files. Then I started the project `TechNews` by command:\
`django-admin startproject TechNews .`
Then I added `requirements.txt` file to reference all needed packages in the project.
// adding app.
These steps were needed in order to initiate the project. From this point, as it was asked in the project document, the project will have a new branch called `ch1`.
